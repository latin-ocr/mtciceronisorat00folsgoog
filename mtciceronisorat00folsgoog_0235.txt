THE ORATION FOR THE ΡΟΕΤ saumas,

ruruuuumtort.

Tuis elegant oration was delivered in the cornu year of Rome, two
years aller the consulship of Cicero, and one year aster the defeat ot*
Catilineand his accomplices. ln early life Cicero had been placed
under the tuition ol Aulus Lucinius Archias, a native os Antioch,
and a man patronised by men ol the greatest eminenee in Rorne for
his learning, genius, and politeness. His eelehrity was so great,
that Lucullus invited him ιο reside in his family, sad gave him the
privilege os opening a school in it, to which many οι the young Ro·
man nobility were sent to be educated. The prosperity of tius popu-
lar poet and instructor, however, was interrupted by the malignity
of an obscure person, os the name ol' Gracchus, or by the subornation
of those who persuaded him ιο acts of eumity against Archias. Syl·
vanus and Carbo had passed a law, which enacted, that those should
he eeteemed Roman citizens, who were admitted to the freedom of
tlt till ltililgtilhl'nlhtllltili thltltllffgtlslt
the, roetor within sixty dayyh. Upon this law, in the consulship ot*
M. ἓ). Piso and M. V. Messala, Gracchus accused Archias; he ¹said
that Archias lived in the city ss a citiren, while he was not entrtled
to the rights of citizenship. lle denied that Archias was admitted
to the sreedom ot‘ any οι the confederated cities, that he had an ahode
in ltaly, at the time the law was passed, and that he had claimed the
privileges ol' a citizen before the pretor. ln this oration, which was
delivered before the praetor, Cicero defends Archias, his friend and
former instructor: he refutes the alle 'ons of Gracchus, and proves
that Archias was admitted to the reedom of Heraclea and other

to Dr. Middleton, Cicero “expected sor his pains an immortality ot
lame from the praises os Archias's muse3 but, by a contrary fate of
things, instead ol' deriving any addition cippory t'rom Archias’s corn-
positions, it is wholly owing to his own, at the name of Archias
has not long ago been huried in oblivion. From the great character
given by him of the talents and genius os this poet, we cannot help

dates, and was now attempting the eo'nsulship os Cicero; but this

erished with the rest, or, rather, was leit unhnrshed, and interrupted
hy his death, since we find no further mention ofit in Cicero's later

writings.” At the time os delivering this oration, Cicero was in the
sowy-sixth yefff his age.
