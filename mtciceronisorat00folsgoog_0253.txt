of the senae, because tbc murder of Clodius was committed in self· 102
defense, ιο which every inan had a natural right.

4. Ambusti tribuni pletis: The epithet centuni was applied ιο Mu· 103
nauus Plancus, because he instigated and miano the people to burn
the court, and the deslrnseats, tables, and books in the forum-ln
termentum cmrciones: These short-lived haranguea, by asserting that
the senate was uuder the control cf Cicero, irnplied, that the senate
decreed nothing against Milo, which contradiction to the assertione
of the other enemres of Milo, Cicero here notices.

13. Hunc questionem: ‘⁸ This extraordinary trisl.”

17. Ince-sto stupro: The word incestus was used hythe Romans in
relation not only tc a kineworuan, but also to a vesta! virgin, or any
female immediatel employed in performing the rites and cerenio-
nies cf religion. h is therefore properly applied to Clodius in rela-
tion ιο Ceasar's wife, while she was engaged in celebrating the mys·
teries of Bono Dec.

18. Potestas essct erepta ‚¹ When the affair cf Clodius's pollutin tlre
mysteries of Bona Dea was brought before the senate, it was resdved
to refer it ιο the colle of priests, who declared it to be an abominable

bunegs, supported by all the Clodian fection, would not permit the
law to be offered to the suffrnges of the citizens. The affair being
likely ιο produce great disorders, Hortensius proposed an expedient,
which was accepted by both parties, that the tribune fusius should
publish a law for the trial os Clodius by the praetor, with a select
bench of 'udgen The consequence was, that by briberya majority
of plhe judgep were induced to aequit Clodius, and be thus escaped
wit rm unr .

29. Adipte :y Vid understood. Cicero bere artfplly insinuates, that,
though the senate had found the fray upon the Appian Way to be
sn act of treason against the commonwealth, yet that Milo could
never be affected by that decree, became says he, it was the vio·
lence, that constituted the treason. Now Clodius, the aggressor,
was the author cf the violence, and not Milo,to whom the principles
of aelf-defense, without an regard to the consequences‚ gave a
right ιο preserve his own lili.

32. Quot ei, etc.- Had not the senate been controlled by the tri-
bune Munatius Plancus, they would have decreed‚ that Milo should
be tripid in the usual form, and he probably would bave been ac·

q 36. Divisa sementia: When any opinion, proposed to the senate,
was thought too eneral, and to include several distinct articles,
some of which might be approved, and others rejected, it was usual
ιο require that it rnight be divided. This was the case with tha
first decree relative to the death of Clodius; it contained three dis·
tinet charges, it declared that the death of Clodius, the burning os
the court, and the attaclr upon Lepidus‘s house, were acts hostile ιο
the commonwealth. Neitber party would agree to this decree en·
tirely; the enemies of Milo therefore obtained a new decree, that
there should be a special trial of the author of Clodius's death.

36. Postulnnte nescio quo: This was Q. Fusius, a senator, whom ·
Munatius Plancus bad corrupted by bribery. Cicero does not naruc
him, because he was in the senate.

tt. Quid nisi vidisset, etc..· Cicero well knew of what great au-
thority Pompey's opinion would be in this utu? He therefore, with
