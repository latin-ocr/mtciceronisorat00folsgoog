this semaam οι· Antony, Cicero said, he wished that what Anton
ssid was true, as, in that case, many of his friends, who were dea ,
would be living, and then he asserts, that hc had received by lego

ancient coins, and the numeral X ia frequently so crossed (1). S

the number mouuted to decies umero millia scandum, “ teu hnu-

cicerciu dccicssmrtim meaning also “a millicn scutatus· aud the .
grammatical form the present is not accounted sor by the mode of
reckoning sums less udan a miilion. Hence several learned critica
have ado ted the opinion, that Mes, in the rechoningof sestertii,
came ιο considered as an indeclinable substantive noun, in the
singular number, and sestertium as an adjective, agreeing with it in
number and gender, and varying in case aa the position of ἀπίω in
the sentence might require. Thrso inionissupported hythe phrases,
boc Mes, docies plenum, and the lide. The same is true os the nu-
meral adverbs higher than decise According to this explanation,
Hs ducenties in the text is sestertio werce, in the ablativo, gov-
erned by amplius, and is equivalent to ducenties centeno milliacos·
sewum, ‘⁴ two hundred hundred thousand '⁹ or “twenty million sea·

Β. Fateor satiricum, etc.- Cicero insinuatos, that he suceeeded ιο
legacies onlyb the willa of his friends; that Anton succeoded to

both friends an enemies, and defraudinfi their heirs.
