than levity; or whatever he heard he disclused; he could not con·
ceal even his own crimes; iu a word, he considered neither what he
said, nor what he did. There had been for a long time, a criminol

The rhemor of the impenditig danger being thus sprgead, the eehtu·

however, abated not rn the least, he exerted himself every day more
