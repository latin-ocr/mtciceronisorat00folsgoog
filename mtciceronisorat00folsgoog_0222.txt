216 THE onumen FOR

64 says Dr. Middleton, “ that he was delivering a speech of thanlrs, no

only for himself, bnt in the name and at the request of the senate,
where his subject naturally required the embellishments of oratory;
and that all his compliments are grounded on a supposition, that
Caesar intended to restore the republic 3 of which he entertained no
small hopes atthis time, as he signifies ιιι a letter to one of Caew's
principal friends. This therefore he recommends, enforces, and re·
quires from himin his speech, with the spirit of an old Romam
and no reasonable man will think it strahge, that ιο free an address
to a conqueror, ln the height of all his power, should want to be
tempered with some few strokes of flattery.'’ Of this defence every
one will form his own opinion.

at. Gratulationibns: ln his Commentarios, Caesar informs ns, that
twenty-five days os congratulation were decreed ιο him for his suc·
cesses in Gaul, and we are told by Dio, that aller his civil wars forty
days more were for like purposes decreed to him. But the day here
spolren ol', says Guthrie, was to bc preferred to any os these3 because
on it he had extended merny and forgiveness, which are personal
virtues, and cannot, lilre the glories of war, be shared by others.

42. Victores bellorum civilium: The victories of Sulla, Marius, Oc·
tarius and Cinna, were succeeded by sanguinat vengeanoe.

65 20. chadiari: In a note upon this passage, erourlle says, cesar
was destrous of peace, Cicero advised it, and Pompey rejected it.
lt may be a fact that Cesar desired ace, buthe desired only the
peace of slavery, the non-resistance o tame submission to his im·
perious mandates; and, although the general conduct of Pompey
demonstrated that he was neither a great politician nor an able gen·
eral, yet, with manly indignation, he rejected peace, as a republican
should have done, upon such base οοιιιιιιιοιιι.

26. Prudens et scieris....od irueritammoluntarium: Cicero in this
sentence assigns for the whole reason of his joining Pompey what
was only one of hl' inducements. lle really thought that Caesar
lhtnttnitlt llll‘lltm‘le‘llhllflis'ff‘2 talantii}
political prinstple, united himself ιο the Pompeiam party. But he
here tells Caesar, that he sided with Pompey from private, not publio
motives bound by ties of gratitude for the personal favors he had
received llom him, and that, cool, and conscious of his danger, he
plunged, as it were, into voluntary destruction. This apology might
have been successfu13 but it is tobe regretted, that talenta so great
as those of Cicero confessedly were, should be employed in a service
so dishonorable as that of flattery and dissimulation. -

30. Cum capitis mei periculo: The following comment has been
made upon these words. Cicero was not presentat the battle of
Pharsalia, nor was Cato, who staid behind also in the camp at
Dyrrachium, which he commanded with fifteen cohorts, when Labi·
enus brought thern the news of Pompey’s defeat3 upon which Cato
offered the command to Cicero, aa the superior in dignity; and, upon
his refusal of it, as Plutarch tells trs, young Pompey was ιο enraged,
that he drew his sword. and would have killed him upon the spot, if
Cato had not prevented it. Though this fact is not mentioned by
Cicero, yet it is probable he refers to itin this passage.

40. insolentiam certorum hominum.- These were Antony, L. Len-
tulus, L. Domitius AEnobarbus, and Curius. The eompliments pald·
to Caesar's clemency were in part deserved, as it is probable, that, if
