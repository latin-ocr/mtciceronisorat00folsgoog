9. t.s‹1tsmtnsm....ctsmiltsm.· On the day of the election of 8
Consule in the 6536 year of Rome, M. Antonius was elected without
opposition; C. Servilius Glaucia, the Praetor, whom Cicero (in Brut.
c. fxii.) calls tia most wished mss tter coer lived, aad C. hleunnius, a
man of distinction, were the other candidates. Saturninus, s tribune
of the people, and a factione demagogue, was esger t'or the election
of Servilius, but, fearin that Memmiuswould socceed, murdered
him in the presence of e people. The senate immediately charged
the consuls to see that the re ublic received no detriment. Saturninus
and Servilius lled ιο the (lipitoh being besieged there by Marius,
they surrendered themselves upon condition of safety3 but the same
day, before they were brought ιο trial, they were slain by the enraged
citizens.

11. Vicesimum jam diersa: The decree of the senam, chargiug
Cicero and Antonius to see that the republic received no harm, was
passed eighteen days before the delivery of this oration. Cicero calls
it, in round numbers, twenty.

28. Certd dc consd: The munus which induced Cicero not to put
Catiliue ιο death, were, &cause there were many in the city, and
even some in the senate, who did not think Catilius guilty, and who
would have called Cicero a tyraut, if he had ordered hrm tobe killed3
because, although Catiline were dead, yet the conspiracy would not
be sup ressed; but, should he be obn d to leave the city, it was
probable he would carry with him ali e profligate and desperate,
and because it would be more safe to contend with an open enemy,
than a secret, artfnl, and bloody·minded conspiracy.

39. Continm ocem: B the intrigues of Fulvia aud Curius, her
paramour, Cicero was in ormed cf all the pians aud proceedings of
the conspirators. See Introduction, p. 165.

tt. XII. Cclcndos Novensbrs's: The Twelsth of the Kalends of No-
vember was the twenty-first day of October. See Adom's “Rodi-
menn os Latio Grammor,'’ upon the division os the Romen montb.

8. Consiliorum reprimendorum: Many os the principol men ot' 9
Rome had lest the city, because the feared, that they should be put
to death, together with the consul, hy Catiline; for he had written a
letter to Crassus, advising him to depart, which letter was shown to
Cicero. Sec Introduction, p. 166.

which was within twenty-five mies of Reme, and was one of the

should be defeated. Cicero, however, apprehendinp that he would
melre this attempt, put the town in a state of de ence, aud when

Catiline came, cn the nilpht of the first of November, to make an

attack, he found it so we guarded, that he was obliged ιο abendon

Ἥ il'isllcheriifs Ill'i'cliere is a doubt existing concerning the meaninp · Ι
of this word 3 but it is generally believed, that it is either s. name ‚⁰
a street in Rome, or an appellaticn given ιο soldiers armed with

were many more men of influence atthis meeting.
