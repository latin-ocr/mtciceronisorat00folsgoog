31. Legatorum pedibus: Phidippus hsd been in the service of Dei· 79
οιοῐοεὲο dpputies, and perhaps in no more honorabis s capacity than
thato a ootman.

9. Sedrtud sopientid fit equissimum: Sufficieut hes already been 80
said concerning Cicero's flattery of Coessr.

ll. Neruo enimserd est, etc: This observation is just, and Cicero
deserves credit for suggesting it to Cressr. Wheus man is both

34. Qui pro multis supe dixisti: ln s note to a former oration (page
77, line 4), we have already observed, thst Cesar, in the early part of
his life,“applied himself to the business of the bar.

38. De camerorum sps.- Thst the student may be able ιο judge
more impartially of the character of Deiotarus sud his aceusers, we
will quote an observation of a judicious commentator. “As to the
facts laid down in this oration, we cun say very little; but, by what
we understand from our author himself in other parts of his writings,
the charges are not so destitute of probability and proof, ss he would
represent them. With regard to the characters, the one given of Dei·
otarus, throughout this oration, 1 am apt to bebere, is very much mis·
represented, for, by ull other accounts, he uppem ιο have been s
monster of blood and cruelty; since he put to death all his own
children, und aflerwards Castor's own father, which may well ac·
count for Castor's appearing in the prosecution”

19. Si....ecausatione mutis usur essa: lt is related that Cesar told 31
Deiotarus, “ You are a ver old man; Pompey is not ιο expect, that
you are ιο take the field, erefore l beg you will not go in person,
though, if you plesse, you may send your troops, nay, your son at
their head; ’¹ and that Deiotarus was so inveterate an enemy ιο Cre·
susp, fihld he would not urge even old age ss an excuse for not taking

24. Errare commum lapsus est: Cicero here srtfull apologires for
Deiotarus without offending Caesar, by paying the tribute of flattery,
which in afew lines follows, and by ap aring to believe the plausi·
ble excuses Caesar bad formed ιο justify lla usurpetions.

2. laquem sirm Dii utque homines, ete.- Env and emulation cesse 82
with the life of the person envied and rivalle . An ambitious man,
therefore, will hear without being offended the praises bestowed upon
a deceased enemy, which, had the enemy been living, would have
induced him ιο inflict upon the panegyrist the dictates of the sererent
vengeance. The encomiums Cicero ere pronounces upon Pompey
were, without doubt, rather pleasing than offensive to Caesar, the
more Pompey was extolled, the more merit the conqueror of Pom·

y attributed ιο himself. Cicero, therefore, who well knew the ef-
feect of compliments‚ deserves here more credit for his knowledge of
mankind, than for the freedom of his praises of Pompey.

23. Ateeundrs'num bellum.- After the battle of Pharsalia, Caesar im·
mediately set sail for Egypt, to which country Pompey had flod aller
his defeat. Upon his landing, the first news he received informed
him of Pom ey's miserable end. He we t, when he heard the ao·
count, and shortly aster ordered a magn' cent tomb ιο be built to
his memor . Atthis time there were two pretenders to the crown
of Egypt, l'tolemy, the acknowledged king, and the celebrated Cle·
opatra, his sister. Caesar ordered both of them ιο maintain their
pretensions before him. Photinus, the young kiug's guardian, dis-
dained ¹accepting this proposal, and sent an army of twenty thou·
