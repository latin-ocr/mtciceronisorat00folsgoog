10 10. Huic ipsi Jom· Statori: The temple in the Capitol was conse·
crated to Jupiter Stator, Juno, and, Minerva3 the cell of Jupiter was
in the middle, os Minerva on the right, and of Juno on the lest. lt
was founded, according ιο Dionysius os Halicarnassus, by 'Tarquinius
Priscus on this occasion, ln a severe battle, which that lring sou ht
against the Sabines, his enemies at first were antoricus, but, ar-
quin having vowed a temple to the deities abovementioned, if they
would turn the tide ol success, the hopes of their assistance ercited
fresh courage in the soldiers, and he by this means gained the vic-
tory. Regardlul of his vow, when he arrived at Rome, he laid the
foundation of the temple, upon which liis grandson, Tarquin the .
Proud, afterwards erected the edifice. lt was burnt in the 670th

ear os Rome, rehuilt by Sulla, and dedicated by Quintus Catulus.

ln the part devoted to Jupiter, Cicero was now speaking to the
senate, and his happy allusion to the cause os the building ol' the
temple made a strong impression upon the mindsof the senators. lt
was dedicated to Jupiter Stator, which appellation was given him,
because he staped the victorious pursuit of the Sabiues, and saved
the Romans from defeat, and perhaps from destruction. Rome,'by ’
the providential discovery ot* Catiline’s conspiracy, was lately de·
livered from ruin equally imminent, and Cicero, no less grateful sor
his remarkable deliverance than Tarquin‚ gave great thanlrs ιο the
immortal gods, and with great propriety to Jupiter Stator in par-
ticular, the most ancient protectores the city, who had delivered it
from early destruction, and had so late preserved it srom conflagra-

tion, and prevented the assissination ol'y its senate and citizens.

Catiline the last year had been rival candidates, aud as Cicero suc-
ceeded not only in being elected to the consulship himself, but also
in excluding Catiline, this assassin had determined ιο attempt to
murder him in the Campus Martius. The vigilance ol' Cicero,
however, defeated his design. The next year, while Cicero was
consul, at the time the Comitia were held, he 'n employed his
influence in preventing the electiori of Catiline, did stood candidate
for the consulship this year also, and Catiline again endeavored to
