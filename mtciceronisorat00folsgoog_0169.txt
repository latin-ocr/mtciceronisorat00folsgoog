leonori, had been settled in the several colonies and districts of ltsly,
in tho possession of landa assigned ιο them b Sulla, which the gen-
erality hsd since wasted by their vices an luxury 3 so that they
wanted another civil war ιο repair their shsttered fortunes.

About the beginning of June (6⁶9), in the consulship of L. cesar
gul C. Fi ulus, Catiline began ιο open his project to his confidants;

’ each o them at first alone; abd having sounded them sufficiently,
so as to rceive their several tempers and dispositions, he called to·
gether a l those who were the most distressed iu their affairs, snd the
most desperately bold; 'udging it now advisable ιο spealt ιο them in
s body. ln this assemb y, there were of senatorias rank, Ρ. Cornelius
Lentulus Sura, P. Autronius, L. Cassius Longinus, C. Cethegus, P.
Sulla and S. Sulla (the sons of Servius Sulla), L. Vargunteius, Q.
Annius, M. Porcius Laeca, L. Bestia, and Q Curius; of the eques·
trien order, M. Fulvius Nobilior, L. suanm, P. Gabinius Capito,
and C. Cornelius.

lentulus was descended from s patrician brsnch of the Cornelias
family, one of the most numerous,as wellas the most splendid in
Rome. His grandfather had borne the title of “ Prince of the Senate,''
and was the most active in the pursuit and destruction of C. Grac·
chus,in which he received adangerous wound. 'l'he grandson,by the
favor of his noble birth, had been advanced to the consulship about
eight years before, but was turned out of the senate soon alter 1)] the
censore, for the notorious infamy of lris life, till, 1)] obtaining the pras·
torship a second time, which he now actually enjoyed, he recovered
his former place and rank in that supreme coancil. His parts were
but moderate, or rather slow; et the comeliness of his person, the
gracesulness and propriety ofhis action, the strength and sweet·
nessof his voice, procured him some reputation ass speaker. He
was lory, lnxurious, arrd profligately wicked3 yet so vain and ambi·

Cethegus, of an extraction equally noble (being of the Cornelian
family), was of a tem r fierce, impetnous, and daring, to a degree
even of fury. He ha been warmlly¹ engaged in the cause of Marius,
with whom he was driven out ο Rome; but when Sulla's affairs

1 beeme prosperous, he presently changed sides, and throwing him·
