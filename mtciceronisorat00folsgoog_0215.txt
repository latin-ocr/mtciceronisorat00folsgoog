the only motive, which indueed Gabinius to publish his law in favor
of Pompey was tho desire of being chosen one of his lieutenants.
Pompey solicited this, but the people reiiised it ; and, although Cicero
here says, that this refusal appeared to him a great indignity, we
must doubt concerning his sinceri since, in another oration (Post

Reditmn in Senatu), be aa s, that gibinus was so necessitous and so
hioffigm at this time, at, if he had not passed tbislaw,bemust
