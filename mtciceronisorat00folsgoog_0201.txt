'l'urs celebrated oration, the first which Cicero delivered from the
Rostra, was oronounced in the berth year of Rome, in the tlst ear
of the oratore age, and three years before the orations against ati·
line. The Romans at thet tune were engaged in war with Mithri·
dates, kin of Pontus. This monarch, able ambitious, warlihe, and
a mona annau in nuumy ruera, a· wel a. ra haeae to ue uo

Pompey, who was then in Cilicia terminatiug the piratio war, should
have the governrnent of Asia added to his commissron, with the com·
mand os the Mithridatio war, and of all the Roman armies in those
parts. This law was much opposed by the senate, who were unwill-
ing ιο confer so extensive authorit upon any individuul, but was so
acceptable ιο the peoXle of whom l‘om ywas a great favorite, that
none but Catulus au hlortensrus, who both passed through the
consulship, dared tc s uh affluet it. Ιι wne defended by Servilius
