7laws, went in an illegal manner, and without any public authority,
intc an assembly of the people, who were then electing Gracchus
tribune a second time, attached him and his friends, and put him tc
death-Pontifex mamimus.- It is tbe opinion os many that Cicero
here applies to Sci
as he immediatel alierwards calls him simply a nate person3 but -
as the Pontifex oximus was not, properly spe ing, a magistrate,
ffle term privatus is rightly applied to him in contrast with cornulas in

esame sentence.

25. Serviliae Arata: In the arath year of Rome, there was a famine
in the city, by means of which, Livy says, a private man was near
obtaining possession of sovereign power. Minucius was appointed
by the senate and people to procare corn in the adjacent countries‚
but met with little success. Spurius Melius, the ricbest private man

' in the commonwealth, had bought up so much os it in the neigh-
boring provinces, that the agent of the ublio could not purchase
rovisions os that kind. The corn, which diebus had purchased, was
liberally distributed among the peo le3 and so great was the popu·
larity he acquired by this artifice an munificence, that a conspiracy
was formed to change the form cf govemment3 Melius aspired to
royalty; the people were to take arms in bis favor, and the tribunes
consented ιο sel the public liberty. Upon the discovery os the.
conspiracy, Τ. Q. Cincinnatus was appointed dictator, who, sup-
posing that nothing but a stroke of autharit could destroy so dan·
gerone a plot, immediately sent Servilius Ahala, bis master cs the
orse, to cite Melius ιο appear before his tribunal. Melius, surprised,
endeavored to make his escape; Servilius commanded a listcr tc

io the title Pontifex Maximus, by anticipation,

arrest him. Melius, im loring the assistance ol the people, was
rescued by the multitude, and again endeavored to escape 3 but
Servilius, pursui him, overtook him, ran him through the body with
his sword, and us preserved the liberties os his country-Nonis
reims chremem: “ Plottin a revolution.¹’

28. Sarranis-conerdtnm: he “decree ofthe Senate,'' ιο which this

passage alludes, was that, which, as soon as there was a rumor of

Catiline’s conspiracy, char ed the consuls to see that rte republic
rgreipetdeno detriment, and which for that purpose invested them with
asou power.

8 6. 0. Gracchus: Gaius Gracchus was a brother of Tiberius Grac·
chus, and, like him, was a savcrite of the people,¹ and opposed to the
Senate. In the 630m year bf Rome, he was chosen tribune, and,
besides many other acts of po ularity, enforced the execution of his
brother‘s Agrarian law, and ad ed tc rt another clause. Marcus Ful-
vius Flaccus was one of the commissioners appointed to divide the
lands. But, two years allerwards, the consul Opimius called an as·

. sembly os the people to abrogate that law, and, during the confusion,
which was common in those meetings, Q. Antillius, cne of his lictors,
was killed. Ο imius excited the senators to execute immediate
ven auce on Gpracchus and Fulvius Flaccus, who were supposed to
be t e authors of the lietor'r death, bnt a violent shower of rain
obliged the parties to separate. On the next day, Gracchus and
Fulvius with their friends were assembled on MountAventine3 the
Senate conferred unlimited power on Opimius, the consul imme-
diately attacked the partisans of Gracchus, and slew Fulvius, bis
soris, and three thousand of lris followers. Gracchus sought shelter
m a wood consecrated to the Furies, but, perceiving bis enemies
approach to kill him. ordered a slave to put an end to bis lise.
