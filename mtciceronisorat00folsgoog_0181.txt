THE SECOND omlou AGAINST cauimus.

Wnan Cicero bad finiahed the receding vehement discoursc in
the senate, Catilius, who was a perdet master of the art of amimu-
lation‚ with downcast loohr aad suppliant voice, “begged of the
fathers not ιο believe too. hastily what had been said 'nst him;
that such-was his family, and such had been the teucro hia whole
life from hia outh up, as mi ht encourage him ιο hope for every
honor ιο couhl aspira to; and it was not ἰο bei ned, that he,
a patrician, whose ancestors, as well aa himself, ha given many
proofs os their affection ιο the Roman pecata, should wrah ιο over·
turn the overnment5 while Cicero, a nonagena tenant only of a
house he had lately hired in Rome, was realoua t‘or ita reservatiou.”

And now, perceiving it in vain ιο dissemble any longer, be received
toenter into action immediately, before the troops os the republic
were increased; and accordingly he letl Rome that ve night with
a small retinue, ιο make the best οι hia way towards hhruna. But,
before be went off, he had a short confereuce with Lentulus, Cethe-

,and others, the boldest οι· the conspiratora‚ in which he pressed

get rid of Cicero as soon aa possible, and prepare t'or a masscere, and
the firing of the crty; and he assured them that he would speedily
return at the head os a strong army.

He no sooner disappeared, than his friends gave out that he was

ne into a voluntary exile at Marseilles. Cicero entertained nc
ddum os his going directly to Manlius's camp, lrnowing that he had
already sent thither a quantity ot' arms, and all the ensigns of military
command, and particularl a silver eagle, tor which he had a super-
stitious regard, because d. Marius had made useof it in hisexpedi·
tion against the Cimbri. However, lest the report should gain belief
in the city, and it should be said that the consul had driven an inno·
