162 THE FIRST ORATION

ol bribery and corruption by the Calpurnian Law, and being brought

· to trial, and found guilty before their entrance into office, their ac·
cusers and competitors, L. Manlius Torquatus and L. Aurelius
Cotta, were proclaiined consuls elect. Some little time asser this,
Catiline, who, on the expiration cf his proetorshig, had obtained the
rovinpe of Africa, came to Rome to sne sor t e consulship; but,
being accused of extortion and rapine iu that government, was not
permitted to pursuc his pretensions.

Ai this time, Cn. Piso, a young nobleman, extremely bold, indi·
gent, aud factious, was instigated, by his poverty and depraved
morale, to, raise disturbances in the state3 with him Catiline und
Autronius entered into a combination about the liuh of December to
assuminate the consuls Torquatus and Cotta, in the Capitol, on the
first of January; which done, Autronius and Catilina were to seize
the consulship, and send Piso with au army to take possession of
both Spains. But, their object somehow getting air, they deferred
the intended assassination to the 5th of February ; at which time they

not a sufficient number of his associatds weregdet assembled’ before
the door ol the senate-house (which frustrated the design), on that day
had been perpetrated the most wicked deed that Rome had ever he-
held since the foundation ol' the city.

Not long aster this disappointment, Catilina was brought to trial
for his oppressione in Africa. Os his guilt nobody doubted; but,

throu h the iniquity of his jud es, he was acquitted.

And the very next year (' 9), when Cicero was a candidate, in
form, lor the consulship, Catiline, being then free, stood against
him sor the same dignity. But the rumor of a dreadful plot, read
to break out, produced a disposition universally to confer the consud-
ship on Cicero, whose abilities were well known. This plot was
the famous conspiracy ol‘ Catiline.

Sallust, aller relating the universal prevalence, at Rome, of those
vices that are the ruin of states, rapacious covetousness, shameless
venality, and boundless luxury, adds, that Catiline had collected,
which in such a city it was not difficult ιο do, a band ol needy prot*-
ligates, who attended him as guards ιο his person 3 that he had
boen very assiduoua in seekin intimacies with young persona chiefly,
whose minds, being soh and pliable, were easily moulded ιο what
fashion he pleased; and that he spared no cust ιο gratify the favorite

become false witnesses; sorge deeds3 and not to stick cren at mur-
der; which they sometimes committed without provocation, without
tem ptation, and merely to keep their hands in exercise.

Depending on the aid of these his friends and anseisus, he formed

adesign to overtum the government, and raiae himself to supreme
power. And it is said,t at his scheme was not without alp-yffi:
