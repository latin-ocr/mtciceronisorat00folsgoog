an cath hom lenimus, Cethegus, Statilius, and Cassius, under their
hands aiid seals, ιο show to their constituente, who, without such
credentials, would never be induced to enter into an engagement so
buiardous. Not suspectin any fraud, all complied, except Cassius
who promised he would in their country in a very short time.
Vulturcius was appointed to introduce them ιο Catilina in their rond,
and Lentulus attho same tima sent a particular letter ιο Cutiliae,
under his own hand and seal, though without liis name. Cicero,
⁹ being informed of all die rcceedings of this meedng, engaged the
deputies tc be upon the ulvian bridge at a certain time of night
with Vulturcius, their letters and papers, aud told them that L.
Flaccus and C. Pomptinus, two os the priators, whom he had ordered
tc lic in ambush near the place with a strong guard of friends and
soldiers, would there arrest them, and bring them to him. His direc-
tions were observed, and the risoners brought ιο his house as scon
as the da began to dawn. Ille immediately sent for Lentulus, Ga-
binius, tatihus, and Cethegus, who, suspecting nothing, came to
him. The consul, being informed also of a quantity of arms provided
by Cethe for tlie use of the conspiracy, ordered G. Sulpicius,
anodier ο the proetors, ιο search his house, where he found a great
number of swords and daggers, with other arms, newly cleaned, and
ready sor present service. Cicero theu assembled the senate in the
