a prelrending there would be an attem t to assassinate him in the
ield of Mars, toolr care to throw back ' gown, and let the people
see a shining bremt-plats, which he wore under it; a precaution
which, deeply imprinting on the multitude a sense of the common
danger, revente , as he told Catiline afterwards ιο his face, his
design ofkillmg, not only him,hut D. lunius Silanus, and 1.. Licinius
Murena, who were declared consuls elect.

Catiline, thus a second time repulsed, and brenthing nothing but

and the sd‘scent parts of Etrunc; Septnmus ιο the territory of Pice-

thought they ml ht be most serviceable to his design. At the same
time, he was busihy employed in contriving the most effectual means
ιο murder the consul, and set lire to the city. He posted armed men

ugyan these measuresfor war, massacres, and con cgratiam, Cicero
received intelligence from Crassus, who, with M. Marcellus and Me·
tellus Scipio, came to his house at midnight, and, having caused him
to be walred, put into liis hand a paquet of letters, which had been
leil with Crassus's porter by a person unlrnown. Among these let·
ters was one directed to Crassus himself, but without the name of
the writer; the rest were directed ιο other senators. Crassus opened
' his own, and finding in itan exhortation to him ιο quit Rome, &cause
Catiline was soon ιο make reat havoc there, he immediately carried
ell the letters to the consui, who thereupon convened the senate
and delivered them,each according ιο its direction. Being read aloud
to the assembly, they were found ιο contaln advices of the same irn-

consuls “ ιο take care that the republic received no detriment.'' Cat·
illne, nevertheless, on the sixth of November, summoned the princi·

Atthis meeting it wcs resolved, that Catiline should put himself at
the head of the troops in Etruria, that Rome should be fired in many
places at once, and a massacre begnn at the same time, that in the
consternation of the tire and massacre, Catiline should be ready, with
his 'fuscari army, ιο talre the benerit of the public confusion, and
make himself master of the city3 where Lentulus, in the mean while,
as first in digrrity, wns to preside in their general councils; Cassius

But the vigilance of Cicero being the chief obstacle ιο all their hopes,
Catiline was ver desirous to see him talren off before he lest Rome3
